    <h3>Laboratory Technician</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="position_description">
    <p>As a Laboratory Technician I worked alongside researh scientists in the Fitzpatrick lab which focuses on uncovering the structure and function of the mammalian visual cortex using cutting-edge imaging technology. In addition to supporting the lab, I designed original experiments and optimized existing protocols to minimize expended materials and time. My favorite part of the job was training colleagues and interns in the operation of advanced instruments. I also ordered and received chemicals for the lab, maintaining inventories and anticipating need.</p>
    <p>Lasting contributions I made to Max Planck include instruction manuals for the use of laboratory equipment, request forms for tissue processing which allowed for more complete records, and a reorginization of antibody storage with the potential to save thousands of dollars in lab supplies.</p>
