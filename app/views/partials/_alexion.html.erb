  <div class="position_description">
    <p>I collaborated with partners to manufacture Soliris, a treatment for rare terminal diseases, in a cleanroom environment. Soliris is approved for the treatment of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. I was only at Alexion for a 6 month long temporary position but managed to identify a major contributor to bacterial contamination in the cleanroom and report it to my supervisor.</p>
